This teaching video is to show a basic understanding of the topic.

"Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.
Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces, this architecture has become extremely popular for designing web applications."
